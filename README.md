# Brain Tumor Detection – Deep Learning

## Description
This project aims to detect brain tumors from MRI images using Deep Learning techniques. 
The objective is to classify medical images by learning relevant visual features through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Medical Image Processing

## Dataset
- Brain MRI images
- Preprocessing steps include resizing, normalization and data augmentation

## Model
- CNN-based architecture for tumor detection
- Training and validation on labeled MRI images

## Results
- Model evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics
- Performance analysis on validation data

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook file
2. Run all the cells sequentially
3. Evaluate the model performance
